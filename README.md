A standalone React-based web app that acts as a wrapper for most of the CC APIs.

### Environment Setup

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Install [Git Command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. On Windows - install [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases/download/v1.22.4/yarn-1.22.4.msi)
4. On MacOS - Install Yarn by running this at a command prompt `npm install -g yarn`
5. A .env_example is provided. You will need to rename to .env and enter the information (api keys, etc.)

### Get the latest build and install dependencies

Perform these steps using a terminal (or Command line in Windows):

1. Create a root folder where you want this project to live.
2. cd to the root folder you just created.
3. At a command line, run this git command:
   `git clone https://github.com/mboucher/api-code-sandbox-react.git`
4. Navigate to the project root: `cd api-code-sandbox-react`
5. Run `yarn install`. This will install all of the necessary dependencies.

### Run the app

Paste this command in terminal / command line: `yarn start`
This will automatically start a local web server with the URL: http://localhost:1234
Once the build is complete, a browser window will automatically launch and display the app.
