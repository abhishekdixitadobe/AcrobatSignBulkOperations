/**
 * Rudimentary helper class used to construct a multi-part body for use in an HTTP POST request containing a file as the payload. Note that
 * the output stream of the HTTP connection passed into the constructor is not closed by this class. The caller must close it when done.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Other than populating the request body, callers also need to set the multi-part boundary as an HTTP header. However this can only be done
 * before retrieving the connection's output stream. So the workflow should be:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create an instance of this class.</li>
 * <li>Retrieve the boundary generated, using {@link #getBoundary()}, for use in the HTTP header.</li>
 * <li>Open the output stream on the connection and associate it with this class instance using {@link #setOutputStream(OutputStream)}.</li>
 * <li>Call the various add methods as required.</li>
 * <li>End with a call to {@link #endBody()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
